## Google_Cloud_PubSub_BigQuery_DataFlow

Googleâ€™s Pub/Sub platform is great for handling large amounts of data and decoupling the various components of our architecture. While this project was not a real-life use case, but could have a very good experience and intertwined different Google Cloud Platform services. With a pipeline like this, you can easily migrate your data from applications to serverless, managed services on the cloud. Once the data is in BigQuery, you can do additional analytics and generate visualizations in Google Data Studio.
