## Google_Cloud_PubSub_BigQuery_DataFlow


In Data Engineering one we made our data Pipeline in a manual way. These kinds of pipelines are great for doing some quick prototypes and exploratory analysis or collecting data in a fast way from somewhere. In contrast, this time in Data Engineering two, the goal is to look at a larger scenario and production qualities. We would have a scalable pipeline and as a result, will more consider the big data. In this schema we guaranty the on timing and availability of the system while people are using it. The whole process will be done in the cloud. So, the main goal of this project is to move from prototype level to production level.

Googleâ€™s Pub/Sub platform is great for handling large amounts of data and decoupling the various components of our architecture. While this project was not a real-life use case, but could have a very good experience and intertwined different Google Cloud Platform services. With a pipeline like this, you can easily migrate your data from applications to serverless, managed services on the cloud. Once the data is in BigQuery, you can do additional analytics and generate visualizations in Google Data Studio.
